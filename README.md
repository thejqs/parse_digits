#A parser! For integers!

It's an exciting time. You have files upon files of of what you presume are integers, but you have no good way to get basic analysis of them. We can help.

Snakes might not normally be your friends, but **consider Python**. Perhaps not the fastest languages, perhaps not the new hotness, but it's perfect for something like this.

With a pair of simple scripts running together in unison and a couple small modifications, you can quickly see: 

- the largest and smallest values
- the median
- the most-common value
- and the total number of integers analyzed to do all that.
